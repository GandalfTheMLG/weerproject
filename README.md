# weerproject

Ignore the Weatherdata Folder, it's a netbeans project not properly exported. BEWARE!

Ignore some of the classes (fucklogic, mysaxterminatorexception, tester, measurethread, saxfilter). 
Just included them because there may be references lying around in core classes (Weatherdata, dataparser, SAXworker, Filemaker). 
Dataset and measurement are just containers. Every json is made from an instance of Dataset.
